# Multipass Ubuntu + K3s = Lightweight K8s goodness

Simple project (shell script) to launch a 3 node kubernetes cluster on multipass VMs using k3s.

Useful as a lightweight local multinode lab k8s playground (e.g. replacement for MacOS K8s in Docker Desktop / KIND which is only single node).

Will also pull down the k3s kubeconfig from the k8s master using multipass copy-files and install in `~/.kube` as `k3s-config` (can be changed in the script) so you can access the cluster from your host.

Tested on MacOS / Linux; currently uses Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for node images

## Usage

1. To create a cluster, clone this repo and adjust the `create.sh` as needed and run it

```
./create.sh
```

2. To start, stop, destroy the cluster (via multipass) see `stop.sh`, `start.sh`, `destroy.sh` - extend or modify these scripts as needed
